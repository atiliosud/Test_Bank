Project c#

Interface Itrade - interface for Trade class (main class)

Class Trade - needs for the properties (Value, ClientSector) and Method Risk Analysis

Method Risk Analysis - check the list of trades and return the list of categories. its a loop checking categories by the client sector and trade value.

RiskKey - dictionary trade risk for future added/removed/modified context. once the project become more complex, it will possible alter the parameter easily instead looking on the methods (its usually became larger) 

TradeValueKey - follows the same parameter key logic above

ClientSectorKey - follows the same parameter key logic above

Program - just for a executing example
